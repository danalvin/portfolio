    <h1>Who is Dan Alvin?</h1>
    <p>my passion about coding started when I was around twelve years old <br>After I got completely intrested
      i decided to watch some YouTube tutorials so that I can learn how to code perfectly. Unfortunately i was overwhellmed by the volumes of information.<br>
      So i heard of Moringa School which was doing coding and it was a very short so in decided to join Moringa and learn how to code
